The Business Administration (BA) course is offered twice a year. During the course the progress and results are monitored and analyzed afterwards. In this report the main findings are presented.

The weekly routine was as follows: beginning of each week there were lectures, two days before the next lecture homework was reviewed and a day before the lecture students could take a knowledge test. To encourage regular studying students could earn bonus points through knowledge and intermediate tests. These bonus points were added to the final exam score. Each individual knowledge test covered the theory of ALL previous weeks. Rehearsal was an essential part of the didactic system. The progress information was regularly shared with the Student Coaches.

Given the results , I recommend the following:

* All students will receive information about the success facors for this module (regular studying and knowledge testing)
* The associated Study Coaches have to make specific agreements (study contracts) with the students about their learning strategy and point out all the available facilities
* During the module the Study Coaches should monitor whether students abide by their contract

In relation to the recommendations the following questions need to be addressed:

* How to check whether Study Coaches have made all necessary arrangements?
* On what kind of signals action will be taken?
* What kind of actions can be taken ?
* What (and for whom) are the consequences if a student does not adhere to his agreement?
